<h2>📖 About the App</h2>

<p>
Water is one of the most essential needs of the human body, yet it is often ignored
in our daily routine. Proper hydration helps maintain energy levels, supports digestion,
keeps the skin healthy, and improves overall physical and mental performance.
</p>

<p>
Water deficiency or dehydration can lead to common problems such as fatigue,
headaches, poor concentration, and reduced productivity. Despite knowing this,
many people forget to drink enough water consistently throughout the day.
</p>

<p>
<b>Hydro30</b> was created as a simple personal solution to fix this habit.
The idea was to design a minimal and distraction-free app that encourages
daily water intake through a structured <b>30-day challenge</b>.
</p>

<p>
This project was originally built for personal use and learning purposes,
and later uploaded to GitHub so that anyone who wants to improve their hydration
habits can use it, modify it, or extend it according to their needs.

<h2>⚙️ How the App Works</h2>

<ol>
  <li>
    When the app starts, the user enters the <b>Hydro30 Challenge</b>.
  </li>
  <li>
    Each day is represented as a card in a 30-day grid layout.
  </li>
  <li>
    The user can add water intake by selecting predefined quantities
    (e.g., 100ml, 250ml, 500ml).
  </li>
  <li>
    The selected amount is added to the current day’s total intake.
  </li>
  <li>
    Progress updates visually, helping the user stay motivated.
  </li>
  <li>
    Completed days remain marked, encouraging consistency throughout the challenge.
  </li>
</ol>
